Hyperparameters Tuning

Here i have two projects

- param_tuning1:

  I compare models between each other(Ensemble Methods, Gaussian Processes, Linear Models, Navies Bayes, Nearest Neighbor, SVM, Trees and XGBoost)
  After this, i chose model with the best perfomence (test score) and do params tuning with GridSearchCV
  
- param_tuning2:

  I compare less amount of models but with all of them do params tuning with RandomizedSearchCV in loop.
  
  Make several pretty visualization graphs:
  
      -Compare perfomance of each model and their scores(f1-score, AUC, Precision, Recall)
      
      -Fit Time of each model.
      
      -Confusion matrixes
